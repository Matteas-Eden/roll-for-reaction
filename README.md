*Roll For Reaction* is an open-source fork of [react-rpg](https://github.com/ASteinheiser/react-rpg.com) created for SOFTENG750/COMPSCI 732 at the University of Auckland. This project aims to enhance the systems already present in the base game by modifying and adding elements to lightly emulate the popular tabletop role-playing game *Dungeons and Dragons: 5th Edition*. In doing so, the following features are planned to be added:
- Implement a simple class system including Fighter, Ranger and Wizard
- Implement ability scores from DnD as character stats
- Rework combat system to involve d20 dice rolls
- Implement a spellcasting system
- New enemy types
- New items
- Better inventory management
